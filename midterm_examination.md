## (10 Points) Provide a detailed, multiple paragraph response to the following question:

Take one laboratory or practical assignment that you worked on this semester
that you struggled to understand and solve and explain how the struggle itself

might fail for this Python program, please furnish all of the steps that you
would take to understand and fix the build failure. Finally, please explain how,
in addition to looking for the green checkmark in GitHub Actions, you would know
that the Python program was fixed correctly.
